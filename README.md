Smooks Java-to-EDIFACT example (based on Java 8): https://github.com/smooks/smooks-examples/tree/v1.0.1/java-to-edifact

Because of [JEP-320](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/320) some modules required for building the example were deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 11. To make the example work again the missing modules were included as Maven dependencies.
